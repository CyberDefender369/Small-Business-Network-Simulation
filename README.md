# Small-Business-Network-Simulation


## Description
This project simulates a secure, multi-VLAN small business network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It incorporates key enterprise features such as inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, NAT/PAT, wireless access, Layer 2 security, and high availability through HSRP. The network is built using a Two-Tier (Collapsed Core) Design and supports common internal services like Web, Email, FTP, and DNS.

## Scenario 
I have been hired to design and implement the network infrastructure for a small business with three departments: Administration, Sales, and IT, along with a separate Guest network for internet access. Each department will operate on its own VLAN to ensure proper segmentation and security.

The network will support internal services such as Web, Email, FTP, and DNS, and provide secure remote access for IT personnel via SSH and HTTPS. To manage internet connectivity and enforce access control, the design includes NAT/PAT and ACLs. HSRP will be used to provide gateway redundancy and high availability.

The following protocols and features are implemented:
* Routing & Services: OSPF, DHCP, DNS, NAT/PAT, ICMP, NTP, Syslog
* Remote Access: SSH, HTTPS/HTTP
* Security & Control: ACLs, Port Security, BPDU Guard, Root Guard, DHCP Snooping, Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)
